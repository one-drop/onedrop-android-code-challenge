# One Drop Android Coding Challenge

# Key takeaways
- Hilt/Dagger : Use for dependency injection, a  principle within SOLID principles (D = dependency inversion)  
- Separated wire models (networks) from app specific ones based on needs per README
- Soft introduction to coroutines : took a chance to showcase how can we adopt them 
- Navigator class to switch between features : 1 so far, details this also helps when we are modularizing an application and our features are by modules
- Following a repository pattern to abstract data layer from view layer
- Due to time constrains (1hr) did not had a chance to fetch location using Location api's nor add proper tests
